# Windows Relative Shortcut Creator
A small AHK script that lets you create a windows shortcut to the working directory that uses a relative path. 

Recomended to be used as a context menu item so as to be easily used in any working dir. (3rd party programs or registry editing)

Opens a file selector that lets you choose the target file. 
The Relative Shortcut is then created in the working directory with the name "%target filename% - Relative Shortcut"

Note that obviously if you move the shortcut or the file, the shortcut will stop working.

Very simple, quite possibly badly made, but it works.

Do with it whatever you wish...
