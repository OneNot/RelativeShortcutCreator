# Windows Relative Shortcut Creator
A small AHK script that lets you create windows shortcuts to the working directory that use a relative path.

Click [here](https://github.com/OneNot/RelativeShortcutCreator/releases/download/release/RelativeShortcutCreator.exe) to download.

Recommended to be used as a context menu item to be easily used in any working dir. ([3rd party program](https://www.sordum.org/7615/easy-context-menu-v1-6/)s or registry editing)

Opens a file selector that lets you choose target file(s). 
Relative shortcuts are then created in the working directory with the following name format "%target filename% - Relative Shortcut"

Note that obviously if you move shortcuts or target files, the shortcuts will stop working.

Do with it whatever you wish...
